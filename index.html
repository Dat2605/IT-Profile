            <p>I’ve always been very passionate about music, so much so that one might even consider that I’m somewhat of a music connoisseur, despite the fact that I’m only able to adequately play two instruments (piano+drums) and have never produced any sorts of music whatsoever.
                I listen to a vast variety of genres depending on my mood, the most recurring one is being in a constant state of existential dread, so them R&B, lofi, reverb, deep 3 a.m thoughts songs hit hard. I’ve also been collecting vinyls as a hobby, whether that be through thrifting endeavours or just straight up going to retail stores.</p>

         <h2>Interests in I.T</h2>
         <p>Informational technology, particularly the aspects of the internet/networking and the idea of staying connected, have always captivated my curiosity and yearnings to learn more about how certain ‘things’ work in the way they do in such an efficient manner. How does one computer communicate with millions of others without any forms of physical tetherings? What does the process even look like?  How is it possible for me to send a message from here to the opposite side of the planet in a matter of seconds with just any feeble smart device and an internet connection? What even is the internet? Not to mention the total elimination of human mistakes/errors during its automated processes… I mean jeez, why are we even here? These are the sorts of questions I’d ask myself ever since my first encounter with the internet through mum’s brand new, revolutionary apple’s iphone 3GS. </p>
         
         <p>In pursuit of gaining a deeper understanding/knowledge of IT and to hopefully find answers for those questions above (and many more), I’ve decided to enroll myself into a higher education after my completion of  VCE. RMIT was the first university that came to mind and for a multitude of good reasons, first being… you know… Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Aside from that, I think RMIT is a very good fit for me being that it’s located in the CBD, which means easier and free transportation. The CBD’s bustling nature also makes it easier to meet and interact with all sorts of new and interesting people which I think is a very critical component in the uni lifestyle, coming from an insufferable long year of remote learning and self isolation. </p>
         
         <p>The expectation I’ve set for myself to undoubtedly gain from this course is that I will know more than I did the day previous, whether that be knowing how to create a website from scratch using html, writing up programs using different programming languages or even learning what an internet is. The main objective for me is to always learn more. </p>
