         <P>Virtual reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to emulate reality and construct a virtually augmented world by hijacking our sensory perception through various specialized software and hardware. The definition of virtual reality itself already sounds out of this world, to be able to visit these virtual environments (where the only limitation is our imagination) at the comfort of our own home is truly mind boggling. But what fascinates me even more is the further applications of this type of technology into different fields of work, it could change the entire foundation of how things are ‘normally’ done in society, the potential is endless.</P>
         <div class="intro">
         <p>VR developers are the ones responsible behind writing and creating software (including productive and entertainment applications) specifically programmed to run on native VR platforms, the predominant and well known ones being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTC Vive </li>
            <li>Oculus Rift/ Facebook</li>
            <li>Windows Mixed Reality</li>
            <li>Playstation 4/ Sony</li>
            <li>iOS</li>
            <li>Gear VR/ android</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Major skills that a VR developer needs to have:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be proficient with 3D modelling tools/softwares such as Unity 3D, Web Vr, Unreal engine, OpenGL, etc.</li>
            <li>Able to code using a variety of programming languages ( C#, C/C++, Javascript)</li>
            <li>Understand and be able to apply the aspects of sound design (background music, audio location and effects, etc.) into VR applications, as sound is one of the two senses to stimulate for immersion in virtual reality</li>
            <li>Have some basic knowledge regarding UI/UX</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being that I’m only in my fifth week of my I.T course, most of these skill sets seem out of reach, but not out of sight. My current course should lead me down the pathway of achieving most if not all of the requirements to become a VR developer. Exposure to virtual reality from the perspective of a consumer, hard work and determination are all the things I could do now as I study and work myself up there.</p>
